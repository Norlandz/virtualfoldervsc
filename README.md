### Introduction

- This is a Virtual Folder.

  You can create more virtual folders inside. \
  Then move your workspace (real) files/folders inside \
  & manage them better inside the Virtual Folder. 

  The underlying (real) files/folders will not be changed \
  (-- thats what Virtual stands for).

- These are Project Folders copied from your current workspace.

  You drag files/folders from here into the Virtual Folder.
